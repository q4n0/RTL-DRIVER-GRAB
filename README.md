   Important Information

Below is important information for using this driver.
1. Blacklisting üö´

If your system has ANY conflicting drivers installed, you must blacklist them as well. For kernels 5.6 and newer, this will include drivers such as rtw88_xxxx. Here is a useful link on how to blacklist a module.

Once you have reached this point, then reboot. Use the command lsmod | grep rtw and check if there are any conflicting drivers. The correct ones are:

    rtw_8723de rtw_8723du rtw_8723d  rtw_8822be  rtw_8822bu rtw8822bs rtw_8822b  rtw_8822ce  rtw_8822cu rtw_8822cs rtw_8821ce rtw_8821cu rtw_8821cs rtw_8822c rtw_8723ds rtw_core rtw_pci

If you have other modules installed, see if you blacklisted them correctly.
